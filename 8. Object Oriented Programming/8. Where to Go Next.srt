If you enjoyed this course you might enjoy a few of my other courses.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I do suggest you watch these to get the complete C# fundamentals experience.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
First is my C# Generics course, at least watch a couple modules here because generics are an incredibly

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
important feature of the C# language. We just didn't have time to cover generics in this course with the

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
amount of detail they deserve, although we did use a generic type when we declared a list to store our grades.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Another important set of features in the C# language are the LINQ features, where LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It sounds like something data related, but in truth, LINQ added a number of wonderful features to the C#

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
language, features like extension methods and lambda expressions, and you don't have the full C# experience

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
until you see these features. And finally there is my C# Fundamentals Part 2 course, which is C# programming

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
paradigms, this course includes some additional material on not just object-oriented programming,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but also functional programming, and what I call language-oriented programming with C#.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I also offer some tips, tricks, and rules to live by as a C# developer.

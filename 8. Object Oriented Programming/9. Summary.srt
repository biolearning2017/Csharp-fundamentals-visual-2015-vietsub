00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module we looked at object-oriented programming in C#, we talked about encapsulation, inheritance,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and polymorphism, and I showed you how to use abstract classes and interfaces.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If all this feels a bit overwhelming, and you're not sure when to use an interface and when to use an

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
abstract class, and when to use an inheritance, I'd say that's normal.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I believe object-oriented programming takes years to master. I started my first object-oriented language in

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
1992 with C++, and with every year that goes by I think I know object-oriented programming just a little bit better.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And that's it for C# Fundamentals Part 1. I hope you enjoyed the course, and continue on with the C# language.

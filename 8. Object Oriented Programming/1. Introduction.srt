Hi, this is Scott, and this is the final module in this C# course.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this module I want to give you the concepts and syntax for Object-Oriented Programming in C#.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
C# is an object-oriented programming language, although you can do more than just object-oriented programming

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in C#, and I talk about those topics in the C# Programming Paradigms course on Pluralsight.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this module of this course we're going to look at inheritance and polymorphism and how to use abstract

00:00:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
classes and interfaces.

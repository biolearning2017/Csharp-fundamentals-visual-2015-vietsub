00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this module we learned that Visual Studio and the C# compiler will compile our code into an assembly.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
By default the assembly name will have the same name as the project, and then we'll have a dll or exe

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
extension depending on if you were building a class library or a program to execute directly.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We also learned that we need more than one assembly for most applications, and we now know how to add

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
references to other assemblies, both .NET assemblies, as well as other assemblies in our solution.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In our solution we had to add a reference from the testing project to the grades project so that the test

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
could see the GradeBook. Remember we also had to mark our Grade and our GradeStatistics classes as public so

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that the test project could use the GradeBook and the statistics that it computes.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in .NET all the types we create will live in an assembly, and the classes that we've built they are one

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
specific type that we can create in .NET. In the next module we'll see additional types that we create and

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
understand two fundamental categories of types in .NET.

Hi this is Scott, and in this module we are going to focus on an important topic in C# development.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The topic is Assemblies. Assemblies are the files the C# compiler creates for us, and inside of an assembly

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is the code we've written for our application. It is nearly impossible to write a C# programming using

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
only a single assembly, so in this module we will learn how to build assemblies and reference other

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
assemblies provided by the .NET Framework, as well as third-party assemblies in general.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Along the way, we'll learn about another vital topic in software development.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The topic is unit testing, and we will learn to write some tests to verify the behavior and functionality of

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
our GradeBook class.

1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this module, we looked at quite a few features of the C# language.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We learned how to create a class definition

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and give a class a constructor.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A constructor is a special method used when we create

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
an instance of the class using the new keyword.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We also learned how we can construct multiple instances

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of the class, and we can have variables that point

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to these instances, these objects.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Two variables can point to the same object,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but also point to two different objects.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We also learned about the public and private

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
access modifiers.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Those play an important role in encapsulation.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And most importantly, we talked about taking

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
some requirements for a GradeBook

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and using those requirements to create classes

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
like GradeBook and GradeBook statistics.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Over time, you'll figure out that these syntax

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of a programming language,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
while it can be challenging to learn,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
can always be mastered over time.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's a little more difficult is learning

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
good programming practices.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That requires you to always think about

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the responsibilities of each class and method

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and which class is going to encapsulate and be responsible

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for which feature.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're going to continue to build on our GradeBook

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and touch on those topics throughout the rest of the course.

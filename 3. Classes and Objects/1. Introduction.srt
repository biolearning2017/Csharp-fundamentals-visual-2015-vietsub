Hi this is Scott, and this module

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is about classes in C#.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Classes allow us to module the world around us in software.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We create custom classes to represent purchase orders,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
automobile parts, employees, accounts

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or spaceships in a game.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Anything you need to write software about,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you can create a set of C# classes to help.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In this module, we'll talk about the relationship

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
between classes and objects and start to learn

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
how you can use C# as an object-oriented

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
programming language.

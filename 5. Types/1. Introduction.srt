Hi, this is Scott Allen, and this module is about the different Types in C#.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Specifically I want to make sure that you know how every C# type falls into one of two categories.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Every type is either a reference type or a value type, and it's very important to understand how these different types behave.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We will look at reference types versus value types and also see how to create these different types of types,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
all of this and more in this fourth module of the course.

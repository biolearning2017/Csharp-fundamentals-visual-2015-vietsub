1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What we've seen in this module is that every type falls into one of two categories, every type is a value

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
type or a reference type. You can use the struct keyword to create a new value type, but the majority of

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
what you'll be creating in day-to-day software is reference types, and you'll do that using a class keyword.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We also looked a little bit at strings and arrays, these are both reference types, but remember the string

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
behaves like a value type because strings are immutable, and you cannot change a string value that already

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
exists, you can only build new strings. In the next module we're going to build on this knowledge,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we're going to start adding some additional features to our GradeBook.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll add those features by adding new members to our GradeBook, class members like methods, but we're also

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:59:00,000
going to look at some different types of members, members like properties and events.

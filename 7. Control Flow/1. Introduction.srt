Hi, this is Scott Allen, and in this module we're going to look at Control Flow in a C# application.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Specifically we're going to look at the keywords and constructs available in the language to perform

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
branching, looping, and to jump to different points in an execution path.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And finally, we'll look at error handling, that is how to throw errors, and how to catch errors,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and potentially resolve those errors.

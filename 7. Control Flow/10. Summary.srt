00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module we looked at flow control statements in C#. These statements included the conditional

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
branching statements like the if statement. We also looked at looping statements like the for loop and the

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
jumping statements like break and continue. Finally we took a close look at exceptions because exceptions

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
are the error handling mechanism that is built into .NET, and sooner or later you will either need to throw

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
an exception because your program has detected a critical error, or you will need to handle an exception and

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
try to either recover from the error or log the error and prevent the program from terminating.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We also saw the importance of cleaning up unmanaged resources like open files and how we can let the C# using

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:59:00,000
keyword help us clean up and free these unmanaged resources.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this module we looked at the different members that you can add to a class.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We looked at fields and properties, which can hold an exposed state.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We also looked at methods again, this time seeing how you can overload methods by writing multiple methods

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
with the same name, but different signatures. Remember the signature is defined not only by the name of the

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
method, but also the types and the number of parameters to that method.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And finally we looked at events, which allow subscribers to listen for interesting things that might happen in an object.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We saw how events are based on delegates, which are useful in other places in .NET programming too.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you want more information on events and delegates I do spend some time on them in both my C# Generics

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
course and my Linq Fundamentals course. The whole goal of seeing fields, properties, methods, constructors,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and events all together is to know what tools are available when you want to build an abstraction in C#.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In this case we've built a GradeBook that encapsulates the behavior of the GradeBook.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It can computer statistics and raise events when important state changes happen.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We'll continue seeing how to build abstractions when we talk about object-oriented programming, but first we

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
will in the next module look at flow control in C#, which is how to branch, and loop, and both create,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and catch runtime errors.

Hi, this is Scott, and in this module we're going to look at the members that you can attach to a type in the C# programming language.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This includes some familiar members we've already used, members like methods and fields, we've attached these

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to classes and structs. We're going to go into more detail on those members, but also

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
introduce new members that you can use, the new members being properties and events.

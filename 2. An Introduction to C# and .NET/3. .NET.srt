00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that I've Visual Studio on my machine, I've also installed the .NET Framework because the .NET Framework

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is part of the Visual Studio installation. When we write our applications in C# with Visual Studio,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
our applications run on top of the .NET Framework, and then our applications can take advantage of services

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and programming interfaces that the framework provides. These programming interfaces include the ability

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to save information into a database, the ability to read information from an XML file, as well as

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
cryptography, configuration, network communications, and all the basic core features that nearly every

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
application needs, and that means you can use C# to build business applications, to build games,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
web applications, and apps that run on different types of phones and mobile devices.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We commonly think of the .NET Framework as consisting of two distinct pieces.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First there is the Common Language Runtime, or the CLR, and there's also the Framework Class Library, or the FCL.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's talk about these two pieces in more detail.

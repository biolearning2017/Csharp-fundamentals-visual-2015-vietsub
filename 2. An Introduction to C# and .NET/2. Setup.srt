1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this course, we will use a tool from Microsoft named Visual Studio to work with C#.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Visual Studio is a Windows-only application, but there is a free version called Visual Studio Community.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All you need to do is go to www.visualstudio.com and click on Download Visual Studio Community,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
start the installation running, and take all the default options.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
After that, you will have installed Visual Studio Community, currently the 2015 version.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you have access to a different edition of Visual Studio, like Visual Studio Professional,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
everything I'm going to show you in this course will work in there to.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And if you're using an older version of Visual Studio, like Visual Studio 2013 or 2010, then 95% of the

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
things I cover in this course will work there too. There are only a few topics near the end of this course that

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
will require 2013 or above. Once you're installation has finished, you should be able to launch Visual Studio

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and write your first program. But before we jump in, let's take a moment to understand what we have installed.

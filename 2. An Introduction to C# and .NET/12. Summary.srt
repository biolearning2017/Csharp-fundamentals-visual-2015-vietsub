00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this first module I intended to introduce you to Visual Studio and get you up and running by writing a simple program.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This program gives you an idea of what the C# language looks like.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And we talked about quite a few concepts, concepts like classes, types, variables, expressions.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Those are all topics that we'll cover in more detail throughout the rest of this course.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What you really want to do right now is try your hand at writing that same program and just getting familiar

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
with the Visual Studio environment. Make sure you know how to create a new project, edit some source code,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
save a file, build a project, and run with the debugger. Learning those basics will help you move a little

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
bit quicker in the rest of the course.

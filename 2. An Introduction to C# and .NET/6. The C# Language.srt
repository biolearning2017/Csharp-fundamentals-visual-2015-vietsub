C# is one of the languages that you can use to write applications with .NET, and the syntax of C# was

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
inspired by C++, so C#, Java, and JavaScript, all three of these languages look somewhat similar.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Here is a snippet of C# code. This snippet contains many different concepts that we will investigate further

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
throughout this course, but let me give you a quick preview. This snippet of code is defining a method named Main.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A method is a place where you can organize your code so that you can call this method from other places and

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
force the code inside to execute and run. The code inside of this method is using the DateTime class,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
which is part of the .NET Framework Class Library. I can use DateTime.Now to find out the current time,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and I can use .DayOFWeek after that to find out the current day of the week.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And if the current day of the week is equal to Monday, and we'll check that by using a double equal sign,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that checks to see if two values are equal, if the current day of the week is Monday, then we will branch

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
inside of this if statement and execute the code inside of the curly braces.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Inside of here we're calling another method, WriteLine. This method is attached to a console class,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
also part of the FCL, so we're forcing WriteLine to execute, and we're passing it some data, a parameter.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're passing it information that is going to write onto the screen.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In this case, it's going to write out the text, Another case of the Mondays!

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But again, that only happens if the current day is a Monday. If the current day is not a Monday,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
we don't execute the code inside of here. We come straight down to the bottom where the method will exit and

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
return without writing any information to the screen. Let's take code very similar to this code and place it

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
into a program that we can execute from the command line.

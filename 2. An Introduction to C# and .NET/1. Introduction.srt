Hi, this is Scott Allen, and this module is the first module of the course designed to give you everything you

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
should know about the C# programming language. In this first module, I want to spend some time showing you

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
the environment and tools you'll be working with and allow you to get everything set up and installed to

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
write your first simple program. C# is a wonderful and popular programming language that you can use to

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
write programs that run tablets, phones, webservers, and desktops.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this module, we'll start to talk about the syntax of the C# language and the different types of programs

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that you can write. But before all the fun can begin, we do need to install some software to help us create

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
our C# programs, and we'll get started with that in the next video clip.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
While the CLR works in the background to manage your application while it is running, it is the Framework

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Class Library of .NET that you will interact with on a day-to-day basis because it's the FCL that contains

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
reusable software that you use to build applications. It provides you all the functionality to do useful

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
work like use regular expressions and read and write data from a disk.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You will also hear people refer to the BCL, or Base Case Library, which technically is a subset of the FCL.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's contained inside the FCL, but it's a subset so it doesn't contain quiet as many features, but it does

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
work everywhere, and that's what we'll be using for this course, the subset that works everywhere.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But chances are when you start building your own applications you'll be using pieces of the more expansive

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Framework Class Library because it is the Framework Class Library that includes software to help you write

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
desktop applications and web applications and web services and apps.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The FCL is so large and so varied that it is rare for one person to know all the ins and outs of the entire library.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Typically you're going to focus on just a couple areas of the FCL and master those.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Like you might become a master of ASP.NET to build web applications because that's what your business requires.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
ASP.NET is just one part of this .NET Framework. And now that we know that we're using C# on top of .NET,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and .NET gives us the CLR to run our applications and the Framework Class Library to give us software

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
components to build on, let's make this all a little more concrete by writing our first C# program.

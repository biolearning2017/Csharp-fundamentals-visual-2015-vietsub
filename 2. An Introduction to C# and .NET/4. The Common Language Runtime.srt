00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In various parts of the course, I'll talk about the Common Language Runtime, the CLR, so it's important to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
note that the CLR is an execution environment for .NET applications, and that includes applications written in C#.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is the CLR that is responsible for bringing your application to life and managing it while it executes,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and it's also the CLR's job to tear down your application when it's finished executing or if it has an unrecoverable error.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And here some of the services that the CLR provides when it's managing your application.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
One is memory management. The CLR is actively tracking all of the memory that your program uses to do work,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and it knows when your program is finished with memory, so it will clean things up and allow your program

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to continue to have enough memory as it runs. The CLR also virtualizes your execution environment,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so for the most part you do not need to worry about what version of the operating system that your

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
application is executing on, you don't need to worry about the specific CPU that is installed on the machine,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
whether that CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit, or how many cores are present, or what instruction set is available.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The CLR will take care of all those things and make sure that your application will execute correctly.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The CLR was also designed to support multiple languages. You can write programs in C#, but you can also write

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
.NET programs in Visual Basic or F#. In fact, there are many different languages you can use to write .NET

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
applications, and all those applications will be managed by the same CLR.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The CLR is available for every version of Windows since Windows XP.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's also a CLR for mobile phones like Windows Phone 8 and a new version of the CLR, the CoreCLR,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
will even run on non-Windows machines, like MacBook's running OS X and Linux machines.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
For the most part, you don't care which operating system you are on.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Certainly what we will cover in this course will be code that can run anywhere; although, there's always an

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
option to use an operating-specific feature that would tie your code to a specific platform.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But, as I said, we'll focus on the features of C# and the .NET Framework Class Library that will work anywhere.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And speaking of the Framework Class Library, let me give you a quick overview of the FCL.
